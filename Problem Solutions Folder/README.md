We've got our analysis, and we've formed our base table, all that's left to do is generate the insights and customize our report!

# Category Insights <a name='catin'></a>

To generate insights, we are kicking off by creating a base dataset which includes the <code>rental_date</code> column in order to break ties between top categories, such that the latest rented film's category will be chosen. Ofcourse, you are allowed to implement anoter tie breaking criteria of your own. 

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS complete_joint_dataset;
CREATE TEMP TABLE complete_joint_dataset AS
SELECT
  rental.customer_id,
  inventory.film_id,
  film.title,
  category.name AS category_name,
  -- also included rental_date for sorting purposes
  rental.rental_date
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.inventory
  ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.film
  ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.film_category
  ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
INNER JOIN dvd_rentals.category
  ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id;
```
|Customer_Id|Film_Id|Title|category_id|category_name|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|130|80|BLANKET BEVERLY|8|Family|
|459|333|FREAKY POCUS|12|Music|

## Category Counts

A follow-up table which uses the complete_joint_dataset to aggregate our data and generate a rental_count and the latest rental_date for our ranking purposes downstream.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS category_counts;
CREATE TEMP TABLE category_counts AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  category_name,
  COUNT(*) AS rental_count,
  MAX(rental_date) AS latest_rental_date
FROM complete_joint_dataset
GROUP BY
  customer_id,
  category_name;
```

For <code>customer_id = 1</code>:

|Customer_Id|category_name|rental_count|latest_rental_date|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Classics|6|2005-08-19 09:55:16|
|1|Comedy|5|2005-08-22 19:41:37|

## Total Counts

A table generated to get a count of the entire number of rentals by every customer.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS total_counts;
CREATE TEMP TABLE total_counts AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  SUM(rental_count) AS total_count
FROM category_counts
GROUP BY
  customer_id;
```

## Top Categories

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS top_categories;
CREATE TEMP TABLE top_categories AS
WITH ranked_cte AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    category_name,
    rental_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id
      ORDER BY
        rental_count DESC,
        latest_rental_date DESC,
        category_name
    ) AS category_rank
  FROM category_counts
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_cte
WHERE category_rank <= 2;
```
|Customer_Id|category_name|rental_count|category_rank|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Classics|6|1|
|1|Comedy|5|2|
|2|Sports|5|1|

## Average Category Count

We will use <code> category_counts </code> table to generate the average aggregated rental count for each category rounded down to the nearest integer using the FLOOR function.

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS average_category_count;
CREATE TEMP TABLE average_category_count AS
SELECT
  category_name,
  FLOOR(AVG(rental_count)) AS category_average
FROM category_counts
GROUP BY category_name;
```

## Top Category Percentile 

This is to obtain the fact of what percentile the customer falls in compared to other customers for a particular category.

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS top_category_percentile;
CREATE TEMP TABLE top_category_percentile AS
WITH calculated_cte AS (
SELECT
  top_categories.customer_id,
  top_categories.category_name AS top_category_name,
  top_categories.rental_count,
  category_counts.category_name,
  top_categories.category_rank,
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY category_counts.category_name
    ORDER BY category_counts.rental_count DESC
  ) AS raw_percentile_value
FROM category_counts
LEFT JOIN top_categories
  ON category_counts.customer_id = top_categories.customer_id
)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  category_name,
  rental_count,
  category_rank,
  CASE
    WHEN ROUND(100 * raw_percentile_value) = 0 THEN 1
    ELSE ROUND(100 * raw_percentile_value)
  END AS percentile
FROM calculated_cte
WHERE
  category_rank = 1
  AND top_category_name = category_name;
```

## First Category Insights

We will now bring the temp tables together to generate all necessary details that is printed in the template for a customer's top 1 category.

```SQL
ROP TABLE IF EXISTS first_category_insights;
CREATE TEMP TABLE first_category_insights AS
SELECT
  base.customer_id,
  base.category_name,
  base.rental_count,
  base.rental_count - average.category_average AS average_comparison,
  base.percentile
FROM top_category_percentile AS base
LEFT JOIN average_category_count AS average
  ON base.category_name = average.category_name;
```
|Customer_Id|category_name|rental_count|average_comparison|percentile|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|323|Action|7|5|1|
|506|Action|7|5|1|
|151|Action|6|4|1|

## Second Category Insights

Our second ranked category insight is pretty simple as we only need our top_categories table and the total_counts table to process our insights.

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS second_category_insights;
CREATE TEMP TABLE second_category_insights AS
SELECT
  top_categories.customer_id,
  top_categories.category_name,
  top_categories.rental_count,
  -- need to cast as NUMERIC to avoid INTEGER floor division!
  ROUND(
    100 * top_categories.rental_count::NUMERIC / total_counts.total_count
  ) AS total_percentage
FROM top_categories
LEFT JOIN total_counts
  ON top_categories.customer_id = total_counts.customer_id
WHERE category_rank = 2;
```

|Customer_Id|category_name|rental_count|total_percentage|
|---|---|---|---|
|184|Drama|3|13|
|87|Sci-Fi|3|10|

---------
# Category Recommendations <a name='catrec'></a>

Here we tackle the recommendations for both our categories but we must ensure that these films have not already been viewed/rented by the customer.

## Film Counts

Performing the same total counts but now to determine how many times a particular FILM has been rented.

```SQL

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS film_counts;
CREATE TEMP TABLE film_counts AS
SELECT DISTINCT
  film_id,
  title,
  category_name,
  COUNT(*) OVER (
    PARTITION BY film_id
  ) AS rental_count
FROM complete_joint_dataset;
```

## Category Film Exclusions

We will need to generate a table with all of our customerâ€™s previously watched films so we donâ€™t recommend them something which theyâ€™ve already seen before.

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS category_film_exclusions;
CREATE TEMP TABLE category_film_exclusions AS
SELECT DISTINCT
  customer_id,
  film_id
FROM complete_joint_dataset;
```

### Final Category Recommendations

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS category_recommendations;
CREATE TEMP TABLE category_recommendations AS
WITH ranked_films_cte AS (
  SELECT
    top_categories.customer_id,
    top_categories.category_name,
    top_categories.category_rank,
    -- why do we keep this `film_id` column you might ask?
    -- you will find out later on during the actor level recommendations!
    film_counts.film_id,
    film_counts.title,
    film_counts.rental_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY
        top_categories.customer_id,
        top_categories.category_rank
      ORDER BY
        film_counts.rental_count DESC,
        film_counts.title
    ) AS reco_rank
  FROM top_categories
  INNER JOIN film_counts
    ON top_categories.category_name = film_counts.category_name
  -- This is a tricky anti-join where we need to "join" on 2 different tables!
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM category_film_exclusions
    WHERE
      category_film_exclusions.customer_id = top_categories.customer_id AND
      category_film_exclusions.film_id = film_counts.film_id
  )
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_films_cte
WHERE reco_rank <= 3;
```

For customer_id = 1, 

```SELECT *
FROM category_recommendations
WHERE customer_id = 1
ORDER BY category_rank, reco_rank;
```
|Customer_Id|category_name|category_rank|film_id|title|rental_count|reco_rank|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Classics|1|891|Timberland Sky|31|1|
|1|Classics|1|358|Gilmore Boiled|31|2|
|1|Classics|1|951|Voyage Legally|28|3|
|1|Comedy|2|1000|Zorro Ark|31|1|
|1|Comedy|2|127|Cat Coneheads|30|2|
